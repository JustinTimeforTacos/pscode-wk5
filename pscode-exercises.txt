// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

(sum = a+b)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(If number%==0 print "Even Number"
 If number%==1 print "Odd Number")

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(numbers = array of size 5
for i = 0 to 4
    read numbers[i]

sum = 0
for i = 0 to 4
    sum = sum + numbers[i]
average = sum / 5

minimum = numbers[0]
maximum = numbers[0]
for i = 1 to 4
    if numbers[i] < minimum
        minimum = numbers[i]
    if numbers[i] > maximum
        maximum = numbers[i]

write "Average: " + average
write "Minimum: " + minimum
write "Maximum: " + maximum
